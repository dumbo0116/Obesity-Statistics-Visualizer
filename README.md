Thank you for checking out this repository.

I have inserted multiple iterations of my project from different points of my progression in this repository. They are named appropriately, with the final version labelled "final model.py".

To run any of the programs, download the program and the two .csv files (the program requires those two data files to run).

Enjoy!
